If you are interested in resource disaggregation, SoC security, or any topics related to computer architecture, please reach out to Professor Hyokeun Lee through email. If you are not familiar with these topics, please refer to our paper in publication list first, so that we can discuss the topics that you are going to work on. 

Applicants need to meet the criteria below: 
- Your motivation and honest personality are the utmost aspects
- TEPS (TOEIC is not accepted): 300 (new) / 555 (old)
- GPA: 4.0/4.5 (overall) or 3.8/4.5 (major) -> good research experience can compensate low GPA
- Mandatory programming language skills: C or C++, Python (or other script languages)
- Recommended language skills:  Verilog or VHDL or SystemVerilog
- Prerequisite major classes: Computer Architecture, Operating System, Digital System Design, Data Structure and Algorithms

**Notes**: the criteria apply to the candidates of Ph.D. or M.S. program, not undergradate internship. As a life hack, there will be a class for *credit-earning* undergradate interships -- `Research in Electronics Convergence Engineering (Capstone)`, you can freely reach out to me to learn more about computer architecture research
