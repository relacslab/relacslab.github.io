# Disaggregated Memory
Disaggregated memory is a scalable main memory expansion solution that modularly aggregates a large number of memory devices in a separate node. We develop scalable disaggregated memory architecture through advanced protocols (e.g., CXL) and its security-related features.


# Non-Volatile Memory
Non-volatile memory (NVM) is one of the strong candidates for high-capacity main memory; it provides byte-addressability, non-volatility, and high power-efficiency. In this research, we resolve its fundamental issues - reliability and high latency - compared to DRAM. 


# SoC Security
Modern System-on-Chips (SoCs) include more third-party intellectual properties (IPs), as the process technology shrinks in these years. However, the introduction of third-party IPs conversely enlarges the security attack surface. Thus, we address security-related issues in larger-scale SoCs (e.g., chiplet or accelerator-rich SoCs).
